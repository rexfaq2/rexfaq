Hi there 👋
A thousand or more questions on REX token answered by the community (in progress) https://rex-token.com/start or c

THIS FAQ IS UPDATED WITH REX 2.0 WHITEPAPER NEW INFORMATION

The ETA for REX 2.0 deployment is February 2022.

**1) What is the date of birth of Rex Token? And what is the date of birth of the new redeployment?

REX was deployed (and ownership renounced) on Binance Smart Chain on June 20, 2021. Rex 2.0 is set for deployment currently in February 2022. This date is subject to changes, since audits and other tasks need to be entirely completed for the launch to happen. 

**2) Where can I find all the records of AMAs that are being held by the devs of Rex?**

You can find them pinned on the telegram official group: https://t.me/newrextoken. Please be careful with any information published elsewhere.

**3) Is there an official Roadmap?**

**4) Will there be an Airdrop of old Rex tokens for users that held it before the snapshot?**

Yes, and there will be two options for claiming it: Claim Liquid Rex OR Claim Rex as a stake. The second one provides bonuses as explained in the Whitepaper: 

"When claimed as a stake, the stake’s duration must be chosen to be between 30 and 3653 days. Bonus calculation: When staking for 30 days or more, the address receives a bonus of 10% more REX tokens added to the stake’s principal. When staking for 600 days or more, the address receives a bonus of 50% more REX tokens added to the stake’s principal. When staking between 30 and 600 days, the bonus calculation is linear. When staking for more than 600 days, the address receives the maximum bonus of 50% more
REX tokens. **⚠ The REX STAKE created from the airdrop is an irrevocable stake.**

18) Will MREX Token continue in Rex 2.0 with the same contract address? 
Yes, and with new features. There are only 10.000 MREX available in the whole world. And this quantity will never change, since the contract is immutable. MREX could go up in value for the same reason. You can still buy MREX as in today. Here is the contract address: https://bscscan.com/token/0x76837D56D1105bb493CDDbEFeDDf136e7c34f0c4. The last MREX traded went for ~120 USD and it can be bought on pancakeswap.finance by adding the contract address (just the string) on one of the sections in exchange section.

19) Does holding more MREX makes me receive more % of bnb from the auctions ?

No. Only for referals reward. 1MREX = 4% BNB reward. 20 MREX = 6% BNB reward. So the amount varies from 4% to 6%.

20) Can someone win BPD multiple times?

Yes, up until the end of the auction. After, only wallets that didn't win become eligible for the BNB treasury that works in a similar way for BPDs.

21) BPD goes for?

Big pay days.

22) Does BPD appears on the dashboard only if win? And If I don’t claim by the time the next auction starts do I lose it?

Yes. No.

23) How do I achieve ULTRA REXICAN status?

By accumulating 25 bnb or more via referal rewards. In order to receive BNB for referal rewards (plus REX) your wallet needs to hold atleast one MREX.

24) Does it makes sense that in one BPD day all wallets being rewarded are new wallets and in another day all of them are old wallets?

The first address is drawn randomly, then it's given out sequentially. This is the most efficient way to do it on the blockchain as Thomas has explained a long time ago. So all new wallets just means the first one picked is very new. Courtesy of @homuraaaaaa: https://t.me/c/1443915360/10209

19) Why do we need Mrex to scrape the interest? How much do we need it?

Part of REX project game theory and tokenomics comes from MREX and TREX features. Think of them like perks works in a game. Since day zero to eternity, there will be only 10.000 MREX and 1000 TREX, so they are scarce and valuable. This is because their features accelerates your earnings, overall. Since scrape is a feature that needs some kind of control, otherwise a stake (with a timelock) wouldn't make sense, MREX is needed to enable it. You just need one MREX to enable scraping.

25) Are there other Telegram groups for REX?20) Are there other Telegram groups for REX?

25) "It’s to my understanding that if you scrape interest, it lowers your over all shares as well. Does it lower it to the current share rate at the time of the scrape?"

Any scraped interest that goes above the amount of your principal DESTROYS your interest rate, permanently. So any 100% plus interest scrape will make your stake a 0% interest stake afterwards. The shares are dilluted in benefit of all other stakes.
