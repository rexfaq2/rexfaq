Hi there ðŸ‘‹

_A thousand or more questions on REX token answered by the community (in progress)_

_THIS FAQ IS UPDATED WITH REX 2.0 WHITEPAPER NEW INFORMATION_

https://rex-token.com/


**1) What is the date of birth of Rex Token? And what is the date of birth of the new Rex Token?**

REX was deployed (and ownership renounced) on Binance Smart Chain on June 20, 2021. Rex 2.0 is set for deployment currently in February 2022. This date is subject to changes, since audits and other tasks need to be entirely completed for the launch to happen. 

**2) Where can I find all the records of AMAs that are being held by the devs of Rex?**

You can find them pinned on the telegram official group: https://t.me/newrextoken. Please be careful with any information published elsewhere.

**3) Is there an official Roadmap?**

Yes, and it's freshly released! https://rextoken.medium.com/rex-project-timeline-a8f01f044831

Here are some highlights:

REX :: Outlook

ðŸŸ¨ 2022 :: ADAPT and LAUNCH on other blockchains

ðŸŸ¨ 2022 :: INTRODUCE NFT BOOSTS

ðŸŸ¨ 2022 :: INTRODUCE ADVANCED ECOSYSTEM

ðŸŸ¨ 2023 :: INTRODUCE REXAVERSE

ðŸŸ¨ 2024 :: RELEASE FULL ECOSYSTEM ON REX BLOCKCHAIN

ðŸŸ¨ 2025 :: PRIVACY MODE

**4) Will there be an Airdrop of old Rex tokens for users that held it before the snapshot?**

Yes, and there will be two options for claiming it: Claim Liquid Rex **OR** Claim Rex as a stake. The second one provides bonuses as explained in the Whitepaper: 

"When claimed as a stake, the stakeâ€™s duration must be chosen to be between 30 and 3653 days. Bonus calculation: When staking for 30 days or more, the address receives a bonus of 10% more REX tokens added to the stakeâ€™s principal. When staking for 600 days or more, the address receives a bonus of 50% more REX tokens added to the stakeâ€™s principal. When staking between 30 and 600 days, the bonus calculation is linear. When staking for more than 600 days, the address receives the maximum bonus of 50% more
REX tokens. **âš  The REX STAKE created from the airdrop is an irrevocable stake.**

The claimable airdrop will be available during the entire Auction Phase of Rex 2.0. 

**5) Will MREX Token continue in Rex 2.0 with the same contract address and with the same features?**

Yes, but with new features. The scraping function is now part of REX design, and MREX isn't neeeded in order to do it. See section 6.3 of the new Whitepaper: "Withdrawing Stake Interest". It can be done many times, but there are cons and pros to do it in order to maintain tokenomics sustainability. 

Here are the current features of MREX: 

1. Referral rewards: Earn up to 5% of the BUSD sent to auction by a referee (1% per MREX) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
2. Auctions: Up to 10% more REX from auctions (2% per MREX) ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥
3. REX stake DEX: No buyers fee (1% of the stakeâ€™s price) when holding MREX ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

There are only 10.000 MREX available and this quantity will never change, since the contract is immutable. MREX could go up in value for the same reason. You can still buy MREX as in today. Here is the contract address: https://bscscan.com/token/0x76837D56D1105bb493CDDbEFeDDf136e7c34f0c4. The last MREX traded went for ~120 USD and it can be bought on pancakeswap.finance by adding the contract address (just the string) on one of the sections in exchange section. It is currently paired either with BNB or BUSD. 


**6) Does holding more MREX makes me receive more % of Rex and BUSD from the auctions?**

Yes, the bonus goes up until 5 MREX are held in the same wallet. 

**7) How does one achieve Ultra Rexican Status in Rex 2.0? Are the benefits already disclosed?**

The user must reach 10,000 BUSD with referal bonuses coming from auctions and withdraw it in a single transaction. As in today, the benefits for Ultra Rexican Status in 2.0 are not yet disclosed. 

**8) What are the current TREX perks in REX 2.0?**

An address holding 1 or more TREX gets:

1. Staking: 33.3% more SHARES when creating a stake
2. Staking: Ability to create irrevocable stakes
3. Auctions: 50% higher limits (+2,500 BUSD) on purchases via daily auctions. 

**9) What is the current status of The Auction Phase?**

Rex has an auction phase that incentivizes user engagement for the long term. On Rex 2.0 the auction will last 222 days and will benefit users that choose to purchase Rex through it in many ways. Random Personal Big Pay Days being the most desired benefit. Buying Rex through auction provides liquidity to the project, makes your wallet eligible for winning all the amount you invested back (more than once!) and, at the beginning, can lead to a higher ratio of Rex/BUSD purchases. Day one has the biggest ratio, as it is shown in the whitepaper (section 7.2, page 24). 

Remember that now there are two claiming options of the Rex purchase in auction: Claim Liquid Rex OR Claim as a stake. Only the second option makes your wallet eligible for Big Pay Days. This means that a wallet which claims liquid Rex becomes ineligible and is permanently excluded from any future Big Pay Days from the date of the liquid claim onwards. The amount of BUSD winnable is conditioned to the total amount of REX purchased AND claimed as a stake, in BUSD value.


**10) What is the current status of Random Big Personal Pay days in Rex 2.0?**

It's still pretty much the same. You can win more than once. If you never win, your wallet is eligibile for the treasury (post auction phase) pay day. When you do win, chances are that you get all the BUSD you invested back in a single take. Or you split these rewards with the number of wallets that won BPD that day.

**11) "I have been away for a while. I do not remember what I have to do with my REX that I bought before 12/Oct/2021"?**

The only thing you need to do is to wait for the airdrop that will arrive directly in rex-token.com website (while you're connected with your Metamask wallet). Once connected with it, you'll have the option to claim your airdropped REX as a stake, or liquid. The explanations for both pros and cons of each of those decisions are on the whitepaper.

**12) "Please someone do guide me I have rex tokens in trust wallet so what am I suppose to do I have to convert it to 2.0"?**

There aren't any type of conversions of Rex 1.0 to Rex 2.0. The only connection between both is the airdrop. This FAQ won't address directly any type of mathematical formula concerning REX, since the topic is too difficult to put in simple terms - and words! But there is a task force lead by a rexican (@rexqz) that is dealing directly with the fair distribution of REX in the airdrop, and it takes into account several criteria.

**13) "Hi all. Not been here for a while. How are the audits coming on? Any bugs founds from testnet?**

The audits are completely separate from the testnet bug findings and other trials. They belong to third party enterprises focused on... audits. Testnet is dependable on the community feedback and, mostly, the developers work. Currently there's been constant reports of minor bugs on the testnet in the telegram REX 2.0 official channel. They are being addressed as the testnet moves forward. Everyone is invited to join it and collaborate. Remember that a strong community is one of the main things that makes a token like REX sucessfull. So engagement is crucial. There are many rexicans doing voluntary or ocasionally paid work for REX. You can talk with the developer on telegram (@Thomas_REX_Roth) about it, he's very openminded and acessible. Besides, he acknowledges the importance of community endeavours all the time.

**14) "Hello friends! I have a question about sending Trex from one wallet to another. When I send it, the transaction is successful and it reports in my wallet that they have reduced Trex by 1 time. The problem is that in the other wallet (the recipient) I do not receive it and my balance value Trex is 0. Can you tell me what can be the reason? ðŸ™‚"**

Several confusions can be made while dealing with testnet and contract addresses in between mainnet and testnet. Old TREX contract doesn't correspond in any sense to REX 2.0 (mainnet and testnet whatsoever) TREX contract. At the same time, MREX contract does. Users also need to check all the time if they're in BSC testnet on Metamask while changing wallets and making transactions (like sending a TREX).

@baldyboy78
**"Is rex just a copy cat of hex? But with a weaker community?"**

This is a very important question. First, what would be the point of a copycat? If this was the case, why not use HEX instead? There are so many incentives to go for REX right now. We can number just a few: a fresh opportunity to get in early! A completely different chain, with fees a thousand times lower and a whole set of users that potentiatlly will never join HEX, joining REX instead, because they feel late for the first one. Unique features that were thought throughly as developments to HEX (withdrawing interest, moving, selling and buying of stakes!). It's not a weaker community at all, only a smaller one - for now!. And this won't be the case in a very short period of time, since there are no competitors for REX in BSC. 

Last but not least: If you're so fanatic in criticizing REX because it's "a copy" of HEX, you can just extend this criticism to every single successful enterprise on the market (crypto or not). Ethereum was born out of bitcoin. Binance Chain is a fork (also, in numerous aspects, a copy) of Ethereum Chain! AVAX, Fantom Chain (forks of Ethereum). In games, DOTA was once the most sucessfull MOBA, today LoL holds the largest userbase in the world. The examples are everywhere. Uniswap? Sushiswap. Pancakeswap? Spookyswap. All doing very well, with or without sharing chains with each other. 

@KiyokoSumaru: 
**"Many people want to learn about your project but they have a problem with English, so do you plan to spread awareness about your project in different countries where English is not widely known? Do you have a marketing strategy to develop different communities?**

This is a great question, because it gives an opportunity to show how international Rex is right now. All Rex admins, for example, comes from different parts of the world. There are virtually no more than 2 from the same country of origin. Admins are from India, Russia, Italy, US, Brazil, Germany, UK, China, Spain and so forth. Rex is by design a cross continental endeavour. So we are preparing right now a huge volume of translations to at least 5 languages, just to start. You can check some of our initial translations of this FAQ here when the launch happens. 

@KiyokoSumaru: 

**"Currently most investors only care about profits at the moment but ignore the long-term benefits. So can you give them some advice why they should buy and hold this token/coin in the long term?"**

Crypto investors tend to look for rapid growth through increased value of the token that belongs to a certain project. They look for price. Price will attract them. But price alone cannot sustain itself, as we are nowadays very used to see tokens that on day 1 make a 1000% and on day 2 gets a 900% correction. Rex tries to balance this environment with very strong long term incentives. After all, Rex is a project entirely based on stakes (the fiat jargon for this type of investment is "certificate of deposit") and this means that once you stake your token, you lock it for a certain period of time. If you breach the contract, it strongly penalizes you. Rex values time. Time preference over other preferences (like leverage, like pump & dump etc.). Irrevocable stakes benefits, for example, are something of this sort.
